# Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship

Welcome to my Data Science Internship journey with Oasis Infobyte! ðŸš€ In this immersive experience, I've dived into the realms of data exploration, visualization, and machine learning across three impactful tasks. Let's explore the highlights of each endeavor:

## 1. Car Price Prediction
Delving deep into the 'car data.csv,' I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the dataset. Armed with data exploration techniques, visualization prowess, and classification algorithms, I crafted machine learning models for accurate car price prediction. This task served as a testament to my proficiency in unraveling insights from complex datasets.

## 2. Sales Prediction
Navigating the terrain of Sales Prediction, I seamlessly blended exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization. Employing 3D pie charts, graphs, and model evaluation techniques, I harnessed the power of three distinct ML algorithms for precise predictions. This task not only showcased my analytical skills but also highlighted the significance of data-driven insights in the realm of sales forecasting.

## 3. E-mail Spam Detection
In the domain of cybersecurity, I took on the challenge of E-mail Spam Detection. From meticulous data cleaning to feature extraction, I employed three distinct ML algorithms to classify emails into spam and non-spam categories. Through rigorous metric comparisons, I unveiled the effectiveness of each algorithm in combating spam. This task not only honed my technical skills but also underscored the importance of leveraging machine learning for enhancing email security.

## Usage and Contributions
